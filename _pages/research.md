## Current research

### Hydrologic connectivity and groundwater recharge in river corridors
- **Study site:** Kathmandu Valley (example), Connecticut (example)

This project investigates how channel modifications and storage features change hydrologic connectivity and recharge.
We combine field observations, GIS analysis, and a process-based hydrologic model.

**Journal paper:** (add DOI link)

### Groundwater–surface water interactions under hydrologic extremes
- **Study site:** Mountain watersheds (example)

We assess how groundwater sustains streamflow during droughts and how extremes shift timing and sources of flow.
We integrate discharge, groundwater levels, and model calibration.

## Previous research

### Flood hazard modeling and mapping
Built 2D inundation simulations and produced hazard maps to support risk communication and planning.
